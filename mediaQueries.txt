    @media (){ ... }
    eg @media media-type and (media-features){ ... }

    * media types (let us targrt different types of media)
        - Screen @media screen{ ... }
        - print  @media print { ... }
        - speech @media speech{ ... }
    
    * conditions within media types
        - widths @media (min-width: 600px){ ... }
        - orientation @media (orientation: landscape){ ... }
        -specific features @media(hover){ ... }
