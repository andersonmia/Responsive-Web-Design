percentages are absolute units.
_________________________________

the element's width or height will be adjusted relative to it's parent container.

relative units
________________
these are measured relative to a font size or the view port or something else
e.g
    - em : relative to the parent font size
    - rem(root em): it is always relative to the root of the HTML page (the defaults)

General rule of thumb:    
______________________
    - font-size: rem
    - padding : em
    - margin: em
    - width: percentage, em

    When em is relative to the font-size of the element, it scales with the font.
    e.g. if the font is 24px, and the padding is of that element is set to 1em
    then th padding is 24px as well
