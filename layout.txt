divs normally stay top of each other (arrange themselves in rows)

but if the display of the container is set to flex,
then they will turn into columns!!

flex-box
__________
- the flex box can be used instead of the float..
- with flex-box we can space the flex-items using
 justify content.
  (it takes the remaining free space of the flex-container and distributes it to the flex-items basing on the value of that justify-content attribute)
- align-items: this helps to align the flex-items,
incase the flex-items have different heights, this considers their heights, not the height of the item with the max height

flex-direction:
- row: means that the flex-container is row thus the flex-items will be columns
- column: means that the flex-container is a column, thus the flex-items will be rows

* align-items always works on the cross axis
  justify-content works on the main axis
